# TwitterTranslate
## Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxiX59jA-1w&ab_channel=josren
## Description:

#### The purpose of this script is to pull tweets from Canada's official twitter, and to translate them into french so those whose first language isn't english can also read the tweets.

#### This script pulls both the text and imgs from any twitter account and can translate into any language. I just chose @canada's account and french as I thought it would be a good example to use for the demo.

#### I chose this idea because I really wanted to make a twitter bot and noticed that in order to translate a tweet in twitter normally, you would have to click on each individual tweet from the account to get a translation. With my solution, it translates the tweets and you can scroll through the account's full timeline without having to click on each individual tweet

#### Overall I really enjoyed my time in the CS50P course and I was able to get a hold of python really quickly through these lessons. Looking to try out the AI Course next!

#### A big thanks to everyone at CS50 who offer these amazing courses free of charge to everyone! ðŸ˜Š

## Functions:

#### get_tweets: takes x num of tweets and y account, and gets that many tweets from the specific account
#### translate: takes in english string and returns a french string
#### post_tweets: takes text, and img url, and posts them on my twitter account
